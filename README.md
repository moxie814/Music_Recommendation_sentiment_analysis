# Song Lyrics Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on song lyrics using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model predicts whether the sentiment of the lyrics is positive or negative and suggests similar songs based on the user's mood.

## Project Overview

The project leverages an LSTM model to analyze and understand the sentiment expressed in song lyrics. Using a dataset of song lyrics labeled with sentiment scores, the model predicts whether the sentiment of a given lyric is positive or negative. Additionally, based on the sentiment, the project suggests songs that align with the user's emotional state.

## Dataset

The dataset used consists of song lyrics with an associated sentiment score ranging from 0 to 1:
- `0`: Negative sentiment
- `1`: Positive sentiment

The dataset is stored in the file `labeled_lyrics_cleaned.csv` and contains the following columns:
- `artist`: Name of the artist
- `seq`: Lyrics of the song
- `song`: Title of the song
- `label`: Sentiment score (ranging from 0 to 1)

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model is built using the following architecture:

1. **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
2. **LSTM Layer**: Handles sequential data and captures long-term dependencies in the lyrics.
3. **Dense Layer**: Outputs the sentiment score using a sigmoid activation function.

### Model Summary
- **Input**: Tokenized song lyrics.
- **Output**: Sentiment score (between 0 and 1).
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer.
- **Loss function**: Binary crossentropy.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `keras`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `nltk`
  - `sklearn`

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/song-lyrics-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd song-lyrics-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset `labeled_lyrics_cleaned.csv` and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

### Running the Model

To train and test the LSTM model, run the following script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Example of Sentiment Prediction

To predict sentiment on custom input:

```python
def custom_predict(text):
    preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(text)
    sequence = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([preprocessed_text])
    padded_sequence = pad_sequences(sequence, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')
    prediction = model.predict(padded_sequence)
    return prediction
```

### Song Recommendation Based on Sentiment

The model can suggest songs based on sentiment analysis:

```python
def find_similar_songs(input_text):
    sentiment = custom_predict(input_text)
    suggestions = []
    for _, song in songs.iterrows():
        if abs(song['label'] - sentiment) < 0.005:
            suggestions.append((song['song'], song['artist']))
    random.shuffle(suggestions)
    return suggestions[:10]
```

## Results

- **Training Accuracy**: 99.99%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 99.65%

The model achieved high accuracy in predicting sentiment on the song lyrics dataset. Below is the classification report:

```bash
precision    recall  f1-score   support
0.0       0.99      1.00      1.00       988
1.0       1.00      1.00      1.00      1012
```

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Keras**: Deep learning library for building the neural network
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for running the deep learning model
- **NLTK**: Used for tokenizing the text and text preprocessing
- **Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: For model evaluation and preprocessing

## Challenges

One of the challenges faced during this project was tuning the LSTM model for sentiment prediction, as song lyrics often contain subtle or complex emotions. To overcome this, I experimented with different architectures, adjusted hyperparameters like batch size and epochs, and ensured the dataset was balanced and well-preprocessed. Regularization techniques like dropout were also applied to prevent overfitting.

## Future Work

Future improvements to this project could include:
- Expanding the sentiment classification beyond binary (positive/negative) to multi-class (e.g., happy, sad, neutral).
- Incorporating user preferences for song recommendations.
- Exploring transformer-based models like BERT or GPT for enhanced performance on textual data.
